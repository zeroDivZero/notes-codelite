# NEW PROJECT

1. After creating workspace, need to create new project:

   ![New Project](/assets/new_project_1.png)

   Each workspace can have more than 1 project. Active project (build and run target) has project name *italicized*.

2. Example project setup for C++:

3. Right-click project and choose **Settings**, or click wrench icon in upper-left. Set **Working Directory** to `$(ProjectPath)`:

   ![Project Settings Working Directory](/assets/project_settings_working_directory.png)

4. In same **Settings** window, update compiler options as needed; C++ example:
